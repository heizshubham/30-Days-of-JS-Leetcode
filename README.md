# 30 Days of JavaScript — LeetCode Challenge 

This repository documents my **30-day journey of solving JavaScript coding problems on LeetCode**.  
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, understand data structures and algorithms more deeply, and build a consistent daily coding habit.

Each day, I solve at least **one problem**, write clean and readable code, and push my progress here.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Strengthen core JavaScript problem-solving skills  
- ✅ Practice Data Structures & Algorithms daily  
- ✅ Write clean, optimized, and well-commented code  
- ✅ Track progress publicly and stay accountable  
- ✅ Build a reference I (and others) can revisit later
